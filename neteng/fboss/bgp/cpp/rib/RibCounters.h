 * callers no longer sprinkle RibStats increment/decrement calls across the RIB
 * and existing dashboards / HealthValidator keep observing identical fb303
 * values.
 *
 * Counts that the fb303 layer does not (and cannot cheaply) provide -- the
 * per-AFI prefix split and the per-prefix-length counts -- are maintained
 * here as in-memory state for the `getRibSummary` thrift RPC. This is the
 * single home for RIB count maintenance: future summary dimensions (best-path
 * source breakdown, paths/ECMP, ...) are added here rather than as parallel
 * ad-hoc counters.
