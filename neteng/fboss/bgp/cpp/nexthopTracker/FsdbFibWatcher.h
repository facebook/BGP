/**
 * FsdbFibWatcher: Tracks FIB host routes for statically configured BGP peers.
 *
 * Subscribes to per-peer host-route paths in FSDB (e.g.,
 * agent/switchState/fibsInfoMap["0"]/fibsMap[0]/fibV4["10.0.0.1/32"]) for
 * all switch IDs on the device (fetched from the agent), kDefaultVrfId=0.
 * Only static peers (those with exact IP peer_addr from
 * getPeerToConfig()) are subscribed — dynamic peers (CIDR peer_addr from
 * getDynamicPeerToConfig()) are NOT tracked here.
 *
 * Dynamic peers are always directly connected: ARP/NDP must resolve before
 * a TCP/BGP session can form, so FsdbNeighborWatcher handles them with
 * isConnected=true. There is no need for FIB-based tracking.
 *
 * Updates pushed to NexthopCache use isConnected=nullopt (FIB entries do not
 * imply L2 adjacency). NexthopCache enforces source-priority: if a nexthop
 * is already marked isConnected=true by NeighborWatcher, FsdbFibWatcher
 * updates are silently skipped — NeighborWatcher is the sole authority for
 * directly connected nexthops (both reachability and igpCost).
